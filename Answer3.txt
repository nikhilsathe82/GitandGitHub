.gitignore and its importance in version control

.gitigore allows you to ignore certain files from your source working tree from being tracked. When you mention the names
of the files to .gitignore then content of these files is not finally stored in the repository. .gitignore is essential 
part of version control in the sense that you can stop your sensitive or critical data like API keys or environment variables
to get pushed to the repository which can be later seen by everyone. If someone else gets access to such sensitive data
they can easily access your resources which can seriously jeopardize the integrity of your source code.
