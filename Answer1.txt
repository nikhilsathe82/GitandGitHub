Git and Github

Answer 1.
Version Control is the practice of managing and tracking the changes done in the source code using various tools.
Through Version Control, you can efficiently track and see who made the changes to the code at what point of time. 
Version controlling makes it easy for you to roll back to a previous version of the software from the current version.
With this functionality, developers are free to try out new changes in the existing code without fearing that it 
might damage the original code. If anything goes wrong, they are assured that they easily roll back to previous version 
that is stable and working.

Importance in software development
1. Maintaining complete history of changes: Version controlling ensure that all the changes like deletion, insertion, and edits made to the source code
are properly maintained for detailed audit. Maintaining history helps in bug tracking or root cause analysis. 

2. New features in branches of software: Version controlling provides you with facility to create a 'branch' on which
they can develop new features. They can build new features on this branch without altering or modifying the main source code
thus significantly reducing the risks of tampering with the original source code. Once the new feature is developed and
finalized by the project manager, the new branch is merged with the main branch thereby introducing the new functionality 
in the software. The ability to create branch ensures efficient team collaboration and avoid conflicts.

3. Share Code Easily With Others: Integrating the power of version control with services like Github can ensure that you store and 
manage the sources code at remote repository and share with developers sitting at any places across the globe. All developers
can access latest version of the code at the same time without any delay.
