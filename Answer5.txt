Contributing to open source projects is a great way to enhance your 
coding knowledge as well as contribute to various open source projects which
we use on regular basis. The process of contributing to any open-source project on GitHub in
a step-by-step manner is as follows:

1. Fork the desired project
You need to fork the desired project on which you want to work as following this step will first create a copy 
of the project on your Github account. This ensure that you can make a changes to this forked copy without tampering
the original project.

2. Clone the project repository
Once you fork a project, you need to clone this into your local machine so that you can work on this new project.
You can directly download the zip file from Github or use clone command to clone the project.

3. Creating a new Branch
You need to create a new branch to carry out your own development on the cloned project. You can use the checkout 
command to create a new branch and checkout it.

4. Make changes to the code
You can make changes to the code by adding new functionalities to the source code. Once you are done making changes,
you need to add the changes in the staging area and then commit the changes to the repository. you can use 'git add .' and 
'git commit -m "msg"' command to stage and commit the changes.

5. Push the project
Once you make changes in the code, these new changes reside in your local repository. You need to push these changes
to the forked repository on Github. You can use the 'git push' command to push these changes to your Github repository.

6. Creating a pull request
Once the pushing of code is successful, you need to create a pull request to upload the changes made by you to the main
project code and send the code for review by repository maintainers. You need to click on 'Compare and pull request' to 
upload the code to the main original repository.
